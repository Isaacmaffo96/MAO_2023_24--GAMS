# MAO 2023/24 : GAMS CODE

GAMS is a high level modeling system for mathematical programming and optimization. It consists of a language compiler and a range of associated solvers.

The GAMS modeling language allows modelers to quickly translate real world optimization problems into computer code. The gams language compiler then translates this code into a format the solvers can understand and solve. This architecture provides great flexibility, by allowing changing the solvers used without changing the model formulation.
